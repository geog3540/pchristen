         <h2>Map Analysis:</h2>
           <p2> In this map, the places that send the most flows appear to be in the Midwest, with Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas standing out the most among
             the states having flows being sent out.</p2>

             <p3> In contrast to this, the places that are receiving the most flows appear to be in the Southwest, specifically Texas and Oklahoma, which look
               like they have the most amount of flows from other states flowing into them.</p3>

               <p4> The flows are primarily occurring in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast and are largely flowing between these states.
                 Other small flows are taking place along the West Coast and the Rocky Mountains, but these are significantly smaller compared to the flows in the East.</p4>

                 <p5> From this map, the overall pattern appears to be one of intraregional migration away from some states in the Midwest to others in the region as well as to the South.
                   The states that have the highest amount of people per destination are Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, while the most amount of flows occur between Midwestern states.
                   The Midwestern states are losing population overall as shown by the purple choropleth map, while states like Texas, California, and Oklahoma are gaining Population
                   despite having lower numbers of people arriving to them. From this, we can deduce that despite having more migrants arriving to a state like Missouri as shown by the larger
                   blue circle, its population is still decreasing because more people are leaving than arriving when considering the purple color of the state, unlike in California,
                   which is gaining population despite having a smaller amount of people arriving by comparing its circle and green color, indicating more people are arriving than leaving.</p5>
